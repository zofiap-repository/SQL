For now only one script is present, but I am hopeful I will update it with more projects:)

# Books read

This project consists of SQL scripts to manage and analyze a database of books read (data were genarated by [ChatGPT](chatgpt.com)). The scripts allow you to create tables, insert records, update data, and run various queries to extract insights from the data.
